                        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. </p>
                        <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>

                                The two axes of flexbox
                        </header>
                        <p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.</p>
                        <h3>The main axis</h3>
                        
                        <p>The main axis is defined by <code>flex-direction</code>, which has four possible values:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li> <code>row</code> </li>
                                <li> <code>row-reverse</code> </li>
                                <li> <code>column</code> </li>
                                <li> <code>column-reverse</code> </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>The cross axis</h3>
                        
                        <p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your <code> flex-direction </code>(main axis) is set to<code> row </code>or<code> row-reverse </code>the cross axis runs down the columns.</p>

                         </header>
                                <p>Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s break this program down step-by-step.</p>
<p>First is the <code>#include:</code></p>
<p><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // This is called preprocessor directives</code></p>
<p>This is an instruction to the compiler to find and include a set of header files. Header files contain additional code that we can use. In this case, the compiler has been instructed to include<code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, which contains all kinds of useful functions like<code>printf()</code> . We can also write it as<code>#include"stdio.h"</code> . We’ll get into detail about what functions are later, but for now just remember that a function is a collection of code that we can use.</p>
<div class="inside-code">
    <code>
        <pre>
                int main(void)
                {
                }
        </pre>
    </code>
</div>
<p>This code declares the main function. The main function is special- it will always get called and is always the ‘main’ part of your program. If this isn’t in your program, your program can’t run and won’t compile.</p>
<p>Starting the function declaration with <code>int</code> means that this function will give an<code>int</code>  value when it’s done running through its code- it’s this function’s output. <code>int </code> is the ‘integer’ data type, and integers are whole numbers like -3, 0, or 18. So we know that this code will run, and when it’s done, it will give us back an integer. By convention, this integer is 0.</p>
<p>Next is <code>main</code>. <code>main</code> is the name of this function, and as you learned earlier, it’s important to have a <code>main</code> function because your program won’t work without it. <code>main</code> is followed by <code>(void)</code>. This tells the compiler that this function doesn’t take any parameters, meaning that it has no input.</p>
<p>This might not make a lot of sense right now, but you’ll be learning more about this when you start reading about functions in C later. For now, just remember that <code>main</code> is required for your C program, it isn’t taking any input, and it’s giving a number as its output.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the brackets: <code>{ </code>and <code>}</code>. These mark the beginning and end of the function. The open curly bracket (<code>{</code>) marks the beginning, and the close curly bracket (<code>}</code>) marks the end. Everything between the two is within the function.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the meat of the program:</p>
<p>
<code>
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
</code>
</p>
<p><code>printf </code>is a function that takes text and prints it to the screen. The parenthesis indicates what information we want the <code>printf </code> function to take and print to the screen. We show that this is a string we want printed by surrounding it in quotes “like this”.</p>
<p>Notice the \n found within the quotes- this tells the <code>printf </code> function to print a newline. A newline is what gets printed when you hit enter on your keyboard. Without explicitly telling C to print a newline, everything will be printed on the same line.</p>
<p>Finally, the printf() statement is concluded with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). This shows that this line of code is over. Without it, the compiler doesn’t know where one line ends and another begins, so it’s important to include.</p>
<p>The program ends with a return statement:</p>
<P>
<code>return 0;</code>
</P>
<p>This shows that the function is over and that it should end by giving a value of 0 to whatever made it run. When you’re running code on your computer, this is good to have because it allows other programs to interact with yours in a better way.</p>
<p>As before, this line ends with a semicolon to indicate that the line has completed.</p> -->
